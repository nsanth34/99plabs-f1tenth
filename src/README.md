# Containers Overview
![alt text](<../assets/pods overview diagram.png>)

The car's functionality is broken up into a number of containers, with each container being responsible for a single general function of the car. These containers can all be ran, stopped, deleted, added, etc. independently of all of the other containers. This means that we can easily turn off any number of containers if we want to run a specific test and then just as easily turn them back on without every turning off the car.
